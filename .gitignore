# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle
/.project
/.coveralls.yml
/.git
/.git/*
/.settings
/.settings/*
custom_plan.rb
zeus.json

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
!/log/.keep
/log/*.log
log/*.log
/log/*.ok
/log/*.sql
/tmp
/log/*

# Ignore downloaded gems and packages:
/vendor/cache/*

# Include or exclude precompiled assets into repository (to avoid precompiling on production/staging)
#/public/assets/*

# Ignore password-containing files and sensitive directories:
/config/*.yml
/config/deploy.rb
/config/deploy/*

# Ignore auto-generated files:
/db/schema.rb
db/schema.rb
db/schema.*
/coverage/*
coverage/*
coverage/assets/*
coverage/index.html
